class MONET:
    """Core elements of the MONET algorithm.

    MONET (Multi-Task Optimization over Networks of Tasks, Hatzky et al.,
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.21991) is a graph-based multi-task
    optimization algorithm: the tasks are the nodes of a similarity graph
    and each node stores the best solution found so far for its task (as in
    Multi-task MAP-Elites, the task descriptors play the role of the
    centroids of the repertoire). At every step, a random focal task is
    selected and, with probability p_ind, its elite is mutated (individual
    learning); otherwise, its elite is crossed-over with the elite of one of
    its nearest neighbors in the graph (social learning). The offspring is
    evaluated on the focal task and replaces the elite if its fitness is
    greater than or equal to the fitness of the elite.

    This implementation processes offsprings in batches, mirroring the
    parallel mode of the reference implementation
    (https://github.com/ju2ez/MONET): a batch of candidates is prepared from
    a snapshot of the archive, evaluated in parallel and committed with
    elitism. As in the reference implementation, when the selected neighbor
    has no elite yet, social learning falls back to a Gaussian mutation of
    the focal elite; and when the focal task has no elite yet, the offspring
    is a copy of the neighbor's elite (init_strategy="copy") or a random
    solution.

    Note: the "regression" and "plane_dd" operators and the random /
    distance-proportional neighborhood modes of the reference implementation
    are not supported.

    Args:
        scoring_function: a function that takes a batch of genotypes and the
            descriptors of the tasks on which they must be evaluated, and
            computes their fitnesses.
        metrics_function: a function that takes a repertoire and computes
            any useful metric to track its evolution.
        batch_size: number of offsprings generated and evaluated at each
            update.
        num_neighbors: number of nearest neighbors of each task in the task
            similarity graph (the reference implementation uses 1% of the
            number of tasks).
        p_ind: probability of individual learning (mutation); social
            learning (crossover with a neighbor) is applied otherwise.
        neighbor_strategy: how the neighbor used for social learning is
            selected among the neighbors of the focal task, one of
            "best_fitness", "random", "most_similar", "least_similar" or
            "fitness_proportional".
        individual_learning: the mutation operators used for individual
            learning, a tuple with elements among "gaussian_mutation" and
            "polynomial_mutation". If several operators are given, one is
            selected uniformly at random for each offspring.
        social_learning: the crossover operators used for social learning, a
            tuple with elements among "sbx", "iso_dd" and "copy". If several
            operators are given, one is selected uniformly at random for
            each offspring. "copy" adopts the neighbour's elite verbatim
            (no blending) — the hard end of the specialist<->generalist
            dial: accepted copies make a single controller cover several
            tasks, and because the duplicates are exact, the number of
            distinct controllers is a direct measure of generality.
        init_strategy: how the offspring of a focal task without elite is
            initialized: "copy" copies the elite of the selected neighbor
            (when social learning is applied and the neighbor has an elite),
            "random" samples a random solution.
        mutation_std: standard deviation of the Gaussian mutation, relative
            to the range of the solution space.
        sbx_eta: eta parameter of the SBX crossover.
        polynomial_eta: eta parameter of the polynomial mutation.
        iso_sigma: iso parameter of the Iso+Line variation.
        line_sigma: line parameter of the Iso+Line variation.
        top_k_similar: number of candidate neighbors considered by the
            "most_similar" and "least_similar" strategies.
        minval: minimum value of the solution space.
        maxval: maximum value of the solution space.
        repertoire_init: a function to initialize the repertoire.
